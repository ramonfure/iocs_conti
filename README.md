## Overview

This repository contains Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) extracted from the leaked internal communications of the Conti ransomware group. The IoCs have been mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for enhanced contextualization and analysis.

A sample of these IoCs is included in the appendix of the corresponding study, while the complete dataset is made available here for researchers, analysts, and security practitioners.

## Dataset Fields

The CSV file includes the following fields:

- **MITRE Tactic/Technique**: Mapping to specific ATT&CK tactics and techniques.
- **Timestamp**: Date and time when the IOC was extracted.
- **From**: Originating user or entity.
- **To**: Targeted user or entity.
- **IOC Extracted**: Indicator of Compromise identified.

## Access

The full dataset can be found in the file:

```bash
