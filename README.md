# Conti Ransomware - IOC Dataset (MITRE ATT&CK Classification)

This repository contains structured data extracted from Conti ransomware operations, specifically related to indicators of compromise (IOCs) discovered through leaked internal communications and victim reports.

## üìÅ Folder: `data/`

The `data/` folder contains the cleaned and structured IOC dataset (`IOCs_Conti.csv`) used in the analysis for the Master's Thesis titled:

> ‚ÄúStrategic and Relational Analysis of Conti Ransomware Operations Based on Leaked Data and MITRE ATT&CK Framework‚Äù

The CSV file includes the following columns:

- `MITRE Tactic/Technique`: Categorization of the IOC under MITRE ATT&CK
- `Date`: Timestamp of the event or observation
- `From`: Actor/source involved in the communication
- `To`: Recipient/target of the communication
- `IOC Summary`: A short description of the detected indicator

This dataset was prepared using Python, cleaned to remove irrelevant or duplicate entries, and manually reviewed to ensure alignment with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Only indicators with real analytical value were retained.
